Séminaire Mathjeunes was founded by Chinese students in Paris in 2008. 
The participants and speakers were mainly doctoral students and postdoctoral students, 
whose research areas includ number theory, arithmetic geometry, algebraic geometry and related directions. 
Since the 10th anniversary celebration, an academic forum will be held every year in China (if the funding is always sufficient), 
and the speakers are still mainly doctoral students and postdoctoral students. 
It aims to introduce the research directions and specific problems to each other 
and provide a stage for young doctoral students in the initial stage of scientific research.
