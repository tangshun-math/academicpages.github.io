I'm an associate professor of mathematics in [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.cnu.edu.cn/) and in [Academy for Multidisciplinary Studies](http://ams.cnu.edu.cn) at [Capital Normal University](https://cnu.edu.cn).

I received my Ph.D. degree at Université Paris-Sud (now [Université Paris-Saclay](https://universite-paris-saclay.fr)) on March 2011, supervised by [Prof. Damian Charles Rössler](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/rossler).

I'm now the vice dean for research of [Academy for Multidisciplinary Studies](http://ams.cnu.edu.cn) at [Capital Normal University](https://cnu.edu.cn), job applications from young scholars who work in the field of mathematics, statistics and related interdisciplines are very welcome. We currently focus on 

* The imaging technology and the frontier mathematical theory;
* Artificial intelligence and its mathematical foundation;
* Mathematical and statistical methods for big data analysis.

Personal research interests
======
* Algebraic Number Theory
* Arithmetic Geometry
* Arakelov Theory

My current research interests include arithmetic K-theory, arithmetic Riemann-Roch theorem and its applications, special values of L-functions and arithmetic intersection numbers.
